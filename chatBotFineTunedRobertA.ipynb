    "##### As internet digital communication has expanded rapidly, there's been a rising need for smarter and more responsive chatbots to enhance human-computer interactions which is very much helpful with customer interaction and etc. Traditional rule-based chatbots often fail to understand the complexity and nuances of human language. As there is a need for a versatile and adaptive chatbot that can comprehend and generate contextually relevant responses, leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques."

While the Fine Tuned chatbot will be fine tuned using Bart transformer. These chatbot's aims to enhance the quality and relevance of user interactions by employing sentence transformers for semantic understanding, cosine similarity for response retrieval, and BART for conditional text generation. It also checks the intent of the questions are whether positive or negative in nature using text blob which helps to give better experience to the user.\n",
