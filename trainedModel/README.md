  - bjrnstad syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal hair and hearing
    problems affected individuals have a condition known as pili torti which means
    "twisted hair" so named because the strands appear twisted when viewed under a
    microscope the hair is brittle and breaks easily leading to short hair that grows
    slowly in bjrnstad syndrome pili torti usually affects only the hair on the head;
    eyebrows eyelashes and hair on other parts of the body are normal the proportion
    of hairs affected and the severity of brittleness and breakage can vary this hair
    abnormality commonly begins before the age of  it may become milder with age particularly
    after puberty people with bjrnstad syndrome also have hearing problems that become
    evident in early childhood the hearing loss which is caused by changes in the
    inner ear sensorineural deafness can range from mild to severe mildly affected
    individuals may be unable to hear sounds at certain frequencies while severely
    affected individuals may not be able to hear at all

  - hemophilia a and hemophilia b are inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern the
    genes associated with these conditions are located on the x chromosome which is
    one of the two sex chromosomes in males who have only one x chromosome one altered
    copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females
    who have two x chromosomes a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the
    gene to cause the disorder because it is unlikely that females will have two altered
    copies of this gene it is very rare for females to have hemophilia a characteristic
    of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons
    in x-linked recessive inheritance a female with one altered copy of the gene in
    each cell is called a carrier carrier females have about half the usual amount
    of coagulation factor viii or coagulation factor ix which is generally enough
    for normal blood clotting however about  percent of carrier females have less
    than half the normal amount of one of these coagulation factors; these individuals
    are at risk for abnormal bleeding particularly after an injury surgery or tooth

- source_sentence: what are the genetic changes related to globozoospermia under what
    are then the genetic population changes related to cellular globozoospermia
  sentences:
  - this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern the gene associated
    with this condition is located on the x chromosome which is one of the two sex
    chromosomes in males who have only one x chromosome one altered copy of the gene
    in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females who have two x chromosomes
    a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder
    because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene
    males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females
    a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked
    traits to their sons
  - the  years rule is used to calculate the value of the fd to double divide the
    highest rate by  if the highest rate of the fd is  your fd will double with this
    basic formula / =  it will take less than  years for the fd to double
  - globozoospermia is most commonly caused by mutations in the dpyl gene which are
    found in about  percent of men with this condition mutations in other genes likely
    also cause globozoospermia the dpyl gene provides instructions for making a protein
    that is found in developing sperm cells the dpyl protein is involved in the development
    of the acrosome and elongation of the sperm head which are integral steps in sperm
    cell maturation mutations in the dpyl gene result in a loss of functional dpyl
    protein as a result sperm cells have no acrosome and do not elongate properly
    without an acrosome the abnormal sperm are unable to get through the outer membrane
    of an egg cell to fertilize it leading to infertility in affected men researchers
    have described other characteristics of the abnormal sperm cells that make fertilization
    of an egg cell difficult although it is not clear how changes in the dpyl gene
    are involved in development of these characteristics

# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/stsb-roberta-base

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/stsb-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/stsb-roberta-base). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.
